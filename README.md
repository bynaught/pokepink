# Pokémon Pink

This is a work in progress adaptation of Pokémon Red/Blue that aims to make Ditto much more interesting. It is based on the pokered disassembly by pret. I plan to rebalance some of the game, add QOL changes, and make Ditto a starter Pokémon.

It builds the following roms:

* Pokemon Red (UE) [S][!].gb  `md5: 3d45c1ee9abd5738df46d2bdda8b57dc`
* Pokemon Blue (UE) [S][!].gb `md5: 50927e843568814f7ed45ec4f944bd8b`

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).

Thanks to the romhacking community and the pokered disassembly that makes this possible.
